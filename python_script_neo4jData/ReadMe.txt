In this folder there are two files:
1) neo4jstarter_python.py and 
2)test_data.csv 
- the aim is to populate more than 200 nodes for user,watchlist and movies for each of them AND the relationship
patterns set in during the presentation.
-you need the pandas framework to read the dot csv file.
{If you dont have pandas in your systems: hoping that you have python installed :)
-run the cmd as an admin
-type the following command and press enter: py -m install pandas
}
Usage:
run the <<dot py>> file and check the generated nodes long with the their relationships in the neo4j browser. 
Enjoy!
